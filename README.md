# OrangeHrm
In this project, I utilized a Maven project structure and the TestNG framework to automate the testing process for the Orange HRM website. I automated  login module, my info module, and the dependents module to ensure their functionality and accuracy. By automating these , I improved the efficiency of the testing process and ensured a smooth user experience on the Orange HRM website.
